# KiCAD PCB Layout Workflow

This skill guides Claude to perform PCB layout using Konnect MCP tools.
ALL modifications go through MCP tools — never edit .kicad_pcb files directly.

---

## Prerequisites

Most PCB layout operations require KiCAD to be running with the board file open. The IPC
connection communicates with the running KiCAD instance in real-time.

`place_component`, `move_component`, `rotate_component`, and `flip_component` are
narrow exceptions for closed boards. Placement, move, and rotation fall back when
IPC is unreachable. Flip intentionally requires IPC to be unreachable because KiCAD's
typed IPC API has no native footprint-flip command. The file paths use revision-aware
atomic writes: placement preserves pads, graphics, attributes, and models; moves
preserve the existing angle; rotations update the footprint and its child angles;
flips mirror supported geometry and swap front/back layers. If KiCAD is reachable and
rejects a request, the fallback stays disabled to avoid racing a live editor.

If connection fails:
- Tell the user to open KiCAD and load the project
- The board (.kicad_pcb) must be open in the PCB editor
- KiCAD's IPC API must be enabled (default in KiCAD 8+)

## Toolset Loading

Before any PCB work, load the required toolsets:

```
load_toolset('pcb_board')        # board outline, layers, setup, stackup
load_toolset('pcb_components')   # place, move, rotate, align footprints
load_toolset('pcb_inspection')   # inspect footprints, pads, and placed graphics
load_toolset('pcb_routing')      # traces, vias, differential pairs
load_toolset('sch_export')       # update PCB from the saved schematic hierarchy
```

Zones (`pcb_board`: add_zone; `pcb_routing`: add_copper_pour), component/net queries (`pcb_inspection`: find_component, get_component_list; `pcb_board`: get_board_info), and bulk placement (`pcb_components`: place_component_array, align_components, duplicate_component) are already covered by the toolsets loaded above.

Load additional toolsets as needed:

```
load_toolset('config')           # design rule storage: add_design_rule, list_design_rules
load_toolset('verification')     # run_drc, set_design_rules, get_design_rules, check_clearance
```

Always call `get_active_toolsets()` first to see what is already loaded.

## Layout Order

Follow this sequence for a clean PCB workflow:

1. **Board outline** — `set_board_size` or draw Edge.Cuts geometry
2. **Update from schematic** — call `update_pcb_from_schematic` first with
   `dry_run: true`. Review `status`, `coverage`, `diagnostics`, and staged positions.
   Apply only with `dry_run: false` and the exact returned
   `expected_plan_revision` value. The saved schematic hierarchy must be closed in the
   schematic editor, and the target board must be open in KiCad. A conflict is
   non-mutating; resolve it and rerun the dry run. A successful apply is one KiCad
   undo entry, so Ctrl-Z reverses the whole update.
3. **Place components** — position all footprints
4. **Route traces** — connect all nets
5. **Copper pour** — add ground/power zones last
6. **DRC** — run design rule check
7. **Save** — `save_project`

Do NOT add copper pours before routing is complete — they interfere with interactive routing.

## Placement

### Strategy

- Group components by functional block (power, digital, analog, connectors)
- Place ICs first, then their associated passives
- Decoupling caps: within 2mm of their IC power pins, on same layer
- Connectors: at board edges, accessible for cables
- High-frequency components: minimize trace lengths between them
- Thermal considerations: power components away from sensitive analog

### Placement Tools

| Tool                      | Use Case                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `place_component`         | Position one footprint via IPC or safe file fallback |
| `move_component`          | Relocate a footprint via IPC or safe file fallback |
| `rotate_component`        | Rotate a footprint via IPC or safe file fallback |
| `flip_component`          | Set F.Cu/B.Cu on a closed board with geometry mirroring |
| `align_components`        | Align multiple components (top/bottom/left/right/center) |
| `place_component_array`   | Grid placement for repeated elements        |

### Placement Tips

- Use mm coordinates (KiCAD default for PCB)
- Standard grid: 0.5mm for placement, 0.25mm for fine adjustment
- Check component courtyard overlaps after placement
- Reference designator text: F.SilkS layer, 1mm height default

## Routing

### Routing Tools

| Tool                      | Use Case                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `route_pad_to_pad`        | Direct connection, auto L-bend routing      |
| `route_trace`             | Manual segment-by-segment routing           |
| `route_differential_pair` | Matched-length USB/LVDS/Ethernet pairs      |
| `add_via`                 | Layer transition                            |
| `create_netclass`         | Define width/clearance rules for net groups |

### route_pad_to_pad

The primary routing tool. Looks up both pad positions on the board and lays an
L-shaped trace between them.

```
route_pad_to_pad(board, net_name, ref1, pad1, ref2, pad2, layer?, width?)
```

- Emits one segment when the pads already share an X or Y, two otherwise
- Specify width in mm (e.g., 0.25 for signal, 0.5 for power)
- Routes entirely on `layer` (default `F.Cu`) — it does not add a via. To
  change layer mid-route, place the via yourself with `add_via` and route each
  side separately

### route_trace

One straight segment between two explicit points, for when you want to control
the path yourself.

```
route_trace(board, net_name, layer, x1, y1, x2, y2, width?)
```

- Use when auto-routing creates suboptimal paths
- There is no waypoint list: call it once per segment to build a polyline
- Coordinates are board-space mm

### route_differential_pair

For differential signals (USB, HDMI, Ethernet, LVDS).

```
route_differential_pair(board, net_pos, net_neg, x1, y1, x2, y2, gap?, layer?, width?)
```

- Lays two straight traces parallel to the given line, offset `(gap + width)/2`
  either side, so spacing is constant along the segment
- Not a length-matching router: it adds no serpentine tuning, and equal length
  only follows from the two traces being parallel segments. Skew introduced
  before or after this call is yours to correct
- Common pairs: USB_D+/USB_D-, LVDS_P/LVDS_N

### Netclasses

Define routing rules for groups of nets:

```
create_netclass(board, name, trace_width?, clearance?, via_drill?, via_diameter?)
```

The class is written to the project's `.kicad_pro` file, which is where KiCad
has kept netclasses since v7 — the board file is not modified.

Common netclass configurations:
- Signal: 0.25mm track, 0.2mm clearance
- Power: 0.5-1.0mm track, 0.3mm clearance
- USB: 0.3mm track, 0.15mm spacing (90 ohm differential)

### Via Defaults

- Standard signal via: 0.4mm drill, 0.8mm pad diameter
- Power via: 0.6mm drill, 1.0mm pad diameter
- Micro via (HDI): 0.1mm drill, 0.3mm pad diameter

---

## Copper Pour

Zone tools live in the `pcb_board` toolset.

### add_zone

Creates a copper pour area (polygon fill).

```
add_zone(board, net_name, layer, points, clearance?, min_width?)
```

- Almost always GND net on both F.Cu and B.Cu
- `points` is the outline polygon; define it slightly inside the board edge
  (0.5mm inset)
- There is no priority argument, and no `(priority …)` is written, so every
  zone takes KiCad's default. Set priority in KiCad if two pours overlap

### refill_zones

**Must call `refill_zones` after any change that affects copper pour:**
- After adding/moving components
- After routing new traces
- After modifying zone outlines
- After changing design rules

Zones do not auto-update — stale fills cause DRC errors.

### Zone Tips

- GND pour on both layers is standard practice
- Leave spoke thermal reliefs for through-hole pads (easier soldering)
- Use keepout zones to prevent copper in sensitive areas
- Zone clearance typically 0.3-0.5mm from traces

## Layer Reference

| Layer    | Name     | Purpose                              |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| F.Cu     | Front Copper   | Top copper traces and pads     |
| B.Cu     | Back Copper    | Bottom copper traces and pads  |
| F.SilkS  | Front Silk     | Top silkscreen (text, outlines)|
| B.SilkS  | Back Silk      | Bottom silkscreen              |
| F.Mask   | Front Mask     | Top solder mask openings       |
| B.Mask   | Back Mask      | Bottom solder mask openings    |
| Edge.Cuts| Board Outline  | Physical board boundary        |
| F.Fab    | Front Fab      | Top fabrication drawing        |
| B.Fab    | Back Fab       | Bottom fabrication drawing     |
| F.CrtYd  | Front Courtyard| Top component clearance area   |
| B.CrtYd  | Back Courtyard | Bottom component clearance area|
| In1.Cu   | Inner 1        | Internal copper layer 1        |
| In2.Cu   | Inner 2        | Internal copper layer 2        |

### Layer Usage Guidelines

- Route signals on F.Cu and B.Cu (2-layer) or add inner layers for complex boards
- Board outline MUST be on Edge.Cuts (closed polygon or rectangle)
- Silkscreen for reference designators and polarity marks
- Courtyard defines minimum spacing between components
- Use F.Fab/B.Fab for assembly drawings and component outlines

## Design Rule Check

After completing layout:

```
run_drc()
```

Common DRC errors and fixes:
- **Clearance violation**: move trace or component further apart
- **Unconnected net**: route missing connection
- **Track too close to edge**: move inward from board outline
- **Courtyard overlap**: increase spacing between components
- **Zone fill error**: run `refill_zones`

---

## Rules

1. **Never edit .kicad_pcb directly** — all changes go through MCP tools
2. **Always verify placement after moves** — components may snap to unexpected positions
3. **Board outline first** — define the physical boundary before placing anything
4. **Refill zones after changes** — stale zone fills cause phantom DRC errors
5. **Check DRC before finishing** — run `run_drc()` and resolve all errors
6. **Use netclasses for consistency** — define track widths per net type, not per trace
7. **KiCAD normally must be running** — `place_component`, `move_component`, and
   `rotate_component` have safe IPC-unreachable file fallbacks; `flip_component`
   requires a closed board; other PCB edits still require the live IPC connection
8. **Save frequently** — call `save_project` after major operations
9. **Load toolsets first** — check `get_active_toolsets()` and load what you need
10. **Copper pour last** — add zones only after routing is substantially complete
